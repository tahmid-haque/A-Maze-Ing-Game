# A-Maze-Ing-Game
Inspired by The World's Hardest Game, this Windows game is about moving the cursor from a start point to an end point, 
while avoiding obstacles and collecting orbs. It includes a redesigned UI, with user profiles and leaderboards and a set of 5 different 
levels, increasing in difficulty.

This project was designed in Spring 2017 for ICS3UI using Unity and C#.
